// PRE-ALGEBRA.
// lesson 1: place value.

Place value is the value a digit carries based on its position in a number: 503, 5 is in the hundreds position so its value is 5*100 = 500, 0 is in the tens position so its value is 0*10 = 0, zero has no inherent value but it still has to have its position in a number, 3 is in the ones position so its value is 3*1 = 3, to the total value is 500 + 0 + 3 = 503.


Whole numbers start from 0 - infinity.

digits: are the first ten digits 0-9.

place value system:  its a value system because the value of digits change based on the position of the digit.

ones, tenth, hundreds, thousandth, tenth thousandth, hundreds thousandth, millionth...

the value system in base ten, as it increases we multiply by ten, as we decrease we divide by ten.

600,000 , 70,000 , 3,000 , 400 , 50 , 2

7,000,000,000 - 800,000,000 - 50,000,000 - 3,000,000 - 900,000 - 20,000 - 2,000 - 600 - 70 - 3.

// lesson 2: expanded notation.
how to express values in expanded notation
expanded vs standard notation

Expanded notation is simply expressing digits in a number by multiplying them by their place value.

Standard notation is the collapse representation of a Expanded notation: basically a sum of all values


standard Notation   Multiply by Place value   Expanded Notation
        |                    |                     |
        V                    V                     V
      1234 = 1*1000 + 2*100 + 3*10 + 4*1 = 1000 + 200 + 30 + 4

// lesson 3: Inequalities and the NumberLine.
the number line is a horizontal line, that increase from right to left by one unit. and vice versa for decreasing. 

-0->1->2-3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10...

Math Symbol: equalities.
= : equals, != : not equals

Strict Inequalities: comparisons.
< less than, greater >.
the symbols points to the smaller number.

using the number line we can determine if a value is greater than or less then another value.

1 < 2 = true, 2 < 3 = true, 3 > 4 = false,..
