programming c++:
Writing source code: (high level human readable code).

Using Editors: Editors are word processors specifically designed to write code for particular language

Binary / machine code: this is the code that the computer understands, so we need a compiler to compile our source code to machine code.

compiler: translates our code to machine code

Linker: This is a program that helps connect our source code to other source codes written outside our environment: libraries

testing and debugging code.

c++ build process:
1 write our source code in .cpp files.
2 compile our source code into machine code, if no errors happen in compilation the compiler will out put a .obj file this our c++ object 
, the object is passed to the linker program that then links our objects to other external libraries and then it will output an .exe file (an executable)
